# Changelog

All notable changes to DreamCoder will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Phase 3 — H5 Remote Access landed**: access desktop sessions from a phone or browser over LAN. Includes the H5 access toggle with token rotation, QR-code pairing, mobile chat UI, WebSocket remote bridge, and a strict CORS / loopback-vs-token request classifier (`src/server/h5AccessPolicy.ts`).
- Direct-connect session manager and headless connect entrypoint (`src/server/createDirectConnectSession.ts`, `connectHeadless.ts`).
- Static H5 asset serving with long-lived cache for `/assets/*` (`src/server/staticH5.ts`).
- H5 Access settings tab is now visible by default in Settings.
- Performance optimization: bundle splitting (manualChunks), lazy-loaded Settings page, dynamic KaTeX/Mermaid imports.
- Performance optimization: sessionsById Map index for O(1) session lookups.
- Performance optimization: throttle/debounce on noisy polling loops.
- Performance optimization: terminal LRU eviction with active-process awareness.
- Performance optimization: Vec::with_capacity pre-allocation, DEV-only console.warn guard.
- Configurable max live terminals in Settings (3/5/10/unlimited).
- Mermaid/KaTeX render error UI with in-flight Promise deduplication.
- Scheduled-task poll failure toast after 3 consecutive errors.
- `useSessionById(id)` hook for memoized O(1) session lookups.
- E2E benchmark suite (store-e2e, TTI, Tauri RSS).

### Changed
- sessionStore: removed dual `sessionsById` state; replaced with module-level memoized cache.
